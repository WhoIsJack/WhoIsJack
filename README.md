### Heya,

I'm Jonas, a **systems biologist** who combines **experiments** (mainly zebrafish fluorescence microscopy), **computation** (including image analysis, data science, and simulations), and **theory** (from modeling all the way to philosophy) to study **how cells self-organize and coordinate** to perform sophisticated biological functions, such as building organs during embryonic development. My computational work I do almost exclusively with **python**.

Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Mayor lab](https://mayorlab-ucl.webflow.io/) at University College London.

My scientific interests obviously start at cell and developmental biology, but range across evolution, complex systems, computer science, cognitive science, and philosophy - and most especially anything that builds bridges across these fields.

**Some ongoing projects and related links:**

- Developing new conceptual perspectives to understand complex living systems
    - See e.g. the Core & Periphery hypothesis; [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09534)
- Studying the interplay of cell shape and cell fate in the vertebrate neural crest using systems microscopy
    - My earlier systems microscopy work (on a different tissue, the lateral line primordium) can be found [here](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55913)
    - Two blog posts on the topic written for non-experts can be read [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/untangling-biology-microscopes-algorithms-d6528f996faf) and [here](https://thenode.biologists.com/image-data-science/research/)
- Automating microscopes to track migratory cell populations (more on this soon!)

**Some repos worth highlighting (more to come!):**

- My hands-on [tutorial on bioimage analysis with python](https://github.com/WhoIsJack/python-bioimage-analysis-tutorial); a bit aged by now but still good; "vintage", one might say :p
- [The repo](https://github.com/WhoIsJack/data-driven-analysis-lateralline) accompanying my lateral line systems microscopy [paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55913); it's cool but in good ol' python 2 and very much "research code"; my current work builds on this, so newer code is forthcoming!
- [tissue_exploder](https://github.com/WhoIsJack/tissue_exploder): it's basic but it looks fancy, especially in 3D (see banner below)! :D
- [TrackTree](https://github.com/WhoIsJack/TrackTree); another fancy visualization; the day will come when I will actually need it for a paper, I'm sure, at which point I'll be modernizing this code, pinky promise...

**My thoughts on...**

- Complex systems and optogenetics ([review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955067420300508))
- Synthetic developmental biology ([review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952122001367))
