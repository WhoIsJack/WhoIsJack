### Heya, I'm Jonas,

a **systems biologist** who studies **how cells self-organize and cooperate** to perform sophisticated biological functions, such as building organs during embryonic development. To do this, I combine **experiments** (mainly zebrafish fluorescence microscopy), **computation** (including image analysis, data science, & simulations), and **theory** (from modeling all the way to philosophy). For my computational work I primarily use **python**.

Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Mayor lab](https://mayorlab-ucl.webflow.io/) at University College London.

üîß _**I'm currently (mainly) working on...**_

- Developing new conceptual perspectives to understand complex living systems, such as the **Core & Periphery (C&P) hypothesis** üí•
    - **Read the C&P hypothesis paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2024.08.001)!**
    - An accompanying blog post can be found [here](https://thenode.biologists.com/a-short-rant-on-the-present-and-future-of-developmental-biology/research/)
* Studying the interplay of cell shape and cell fate using **systems microscopy** üî¨üêü
    - My current project focuses on the zebrafish neural crest; more on this soon!
    - In earlier related work I analyzed the cellular architecture of the zebrafish lateral line primordium; see [my PhD paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55913)!
    - Two blog posts systems microscopy for non-experts can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/untangling-biology-microscopes-algorithms-d6528f996faf) and [here](https://thenode.biologists.com/image-data-science/research/)
- **Automating microscopes** to track migratory cell populations üî¨ü§ñ
    - Work in progress; more on this soon!

üëÄ _**Some repos you may want to check out:**_

- [Bioimage analysis with python](https://github.com/WhoIsJack/python-bioimage-analysis-tutorial); my hands-on, self-explanatory tutorial; a bit aged by now but still good; "vintage", one might say :p
- [tissue_exploder](https://github.com/WhoIsJack/tissue_exploder); it's basic but it does look fancy, especially in 3D (see banner below)! :D
- [TrackTree](https://github.com/WhoIsJack/TrackTree); another pretty visualization; maybe I'll actually need it for a paper one day, at which point I'll definitely update the code...
